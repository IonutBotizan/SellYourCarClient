<strong> Still lot of work to do </strong>
Angular 2 client for the WebApi Server
- Angular 2 as a main technology 
- RxJs with Observables instead of promises for AJAX calls
- ES6 and CommonJs for module exports
- Bootstrap for CSS style 
- Reactive Forms for Input Forms and  Validation 
-Angular2-Bootstrap for some extra features like pagination 
-As an  IDE  I am doing it in  WebStorm since I can easily import modules and its easier to integrate with Git 
Here is a Snapshot of the work in progress
